============

Here be a program to mirror the webcomic Schlock Mercenary in entirety.

It places each comic in nice folders, I promise.

By creating, modifying and using this piece of software, you and I agree
not to reproduce the webcomic in any way shape or form for profit. I 
created this program purely as a personal mirror for long roadtrips.

Requirements
------------

* RMagick
* Ruby (Any version works, really.)

Use
---

To use, just run main.rb. It will ask you for a directory to put the comics in, defaulting to a subdir (comic) in this directory.

If you stop along the way, the downloader should resume where it left off.

Caveats
-------

Only gets up to 2003 - 12 - 07 's  comic. Why?
Howard Tayler decided to get obsessed with suffixes, that's why.
Looking into it, though.

Potential Addins
----------------

* Compression
* Progress / Speed calculations
* Clone only certain books / divide comics into the books
