Teraport 0.1
============

Here be a program to mirror the webcomic Schlock Mercenary in entirety.

It places each comic in nice folders, I promise.

By creating, modifying and using this piece of software, you and I agree
not to reproduce the webcomic in any way shape or form for profit. I 
created this program purely as a personal mirror for long roadtrips.


Use
---

To use, just run main.rb. It will ask you for a directory to put the comics in, defaulting to a subdir (comic) in this directory.

Potential Addins
----------------

Clone only certain books / divide comics into the books
